# hello-world
This is my first attempt at using GitHub by following the [Quickstart guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart). We all have to start somewhere :)
As of writing this, I'm currently learning Java as my introduction to programming. I've also dabbled with HTML/CSS a lot this past summer!
I hope to expand my knowledge of programming and web design to further my experience.
